To capture an API from a URL using Python 3, we can use the popular requests library, which simplifies making HTTP requests. 
The requests library provides a simple and consistent API to interact with web servers and handle their responses. 
Here's a Python 3 script to capture an API from a URL using the requests library:

In this script, we define a function capture_api_from_url() that takes a URL as input. 
The function uses requests.get() to make a GET request to the specified URL. 
If the request is successful (status code 200), it retrieves the data from the response, assuming the response is in JSON format. 
You can modify the function to handle different response formats based on your API requirements.

Please note that you need to replace 'YOUR_API_URL' with the actual API URL you want to capture data from.

Remember to install the requests library before running the script if you haven't already done so. 
You can install it using the following command:

pip install requests
